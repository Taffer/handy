* `pidgin_emoji.py` - Convert Taehoon Kim's "emoji" module into Pidgin's dictionary format.

## pidgin_emoji

This doesn't actually seem to work in Pidgin 2.10 on Windows; some searching
suggests that the "Text Replacment" plugin isn't very flexible. I can't even
get it to work with canned replacements, such as "it' snot" -> "it's not".
